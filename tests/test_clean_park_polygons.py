def test_data():
    """
    This fixture provides the test dataset as a Python dictionary.
    The data includes named, unnamed, and intersecting parks.

    This fixture creates a sample dataset simulating raw park data in GeoJSON
    format. The test data consists of unnamed parks, named parks, intersecting
    parks, and parks fully contained within another park. This test data is used
    to check that the functions within clean_park_polygons.py are properly 
    identifying and handling unnamed parks, checking for park containment, 
    and merging park clusters.

    The test data covers several edge cases:
    - Parks with no name (unnamed parks) that should be standardized.
    - Parks with names that should remain untouched in the process.
    - Parks with overlaps to test merging and removal logic.
    - Parks fully contained within another park to test removal logic.

    Returns:
        str: The path to the test GeoJSON data file used for testing.
