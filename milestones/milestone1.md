## Abstract
Our group is interested in investigating the availability of high-quality public 
parks and other green space near affordable housing in Chicago. The city’s Department 
of Housing maintains a list of affordable housing rental units, available online 
and updated regularly. OpenStreetMap contains information on locations of green spaces, 
and other websites such as Google and AllTrails allow users to provide ratings on green spaces.

We will reconcile the city’s Department of Housing data with spatial and user 
review data on green space. For the data analysis component of this project, 
we will be developing an index that quantifies the accessibility to high-quality 
green spaces for the various public housing developments. This index will be 
based upon the proximity of green spaces to public housing developments as well 
as the quality of these green spaces, determined by ratings/reviews that we scrape 
from AllTrails and/or Google. 


## Preliminary Data Sources

## Data Source #1: Affordable Rental Housing Developments
- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Affordable-Rental-Housing-Developments-Map/k3g7-7kgc
- webpage
- N/A


## Data Source #2: Open Street Map API
- https://www.openstreetmap.org/about/api/
- API
- Potential challenges:
    - Not all green spaces are public. We will need to ensure we are categorizing 
    the green spaces correctly.

## Data Source #3: Here MAPS API
- https://www.here.com/platform/map-data 
- API
- Potential challenges:
    - Not sure if it's free
    - Unclear if it has reviews or some measure of quality of public green spaces


### Data Source #1: {Name}

- A URL to the data source.
- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?
- Are there any challenges or uncertainity about the data at this point?

## Preliminary Project Plan

1. 
2. Look at a predefined radius surrounding each residence (affordable housing) 
to calculate availability

A short summary of what components of the project might be needed (e.g. data 
ingestion, cleaning/preparation, visualization).

You might also begin to think about who will work on what.
This can be very brief, and will almost certainly change by the next milestone.

## Questions

1. Do you know if it's possible to use Google Places API? Is it free?
    - We may need some Google API to receive reviews of parks/public spaces
2. Does the CS department fund/have resources to run our program on a server?
