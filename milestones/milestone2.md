## Abstract

Update your project abstract from Milestone 1 with any changes.

## Data Sources

### Data Reconciliation Plan

An important thing to do at this step is to have a plan for how data from your various sources will be brought together.

For each data set, you will need to identify the "unique key" that will allow you to connect it to other data sets. (We'll discuss this in more detail.)

Additionally, for each data source, add a section like:

### Data Source #1: {Name}

- Is the data coming from a webpage, bulk data, or an API?
- Are there any challenges or remaining uncertainity about the data?
- How many records (rows) does your data set have?
- How many properties (columns) does your data set have?
- Write a few sentences about your exploration of the data set. At this point you should have downloaded some of the data and explored it with an eye for things that might cause issues for your project.

## Project Plan

Please provide a project plan that will help keep your team on track.

It is recommended that you:

- Identify required (and optional) components of the project to be built.
- Have a plan that makes it clear what will be built by Milestone #3 (it may be helpful to break this out weekly for the remainder of the quarter) and what will be built by the final project.
- For each component, identify who is primarily responsible, and who else might work on it with them.
