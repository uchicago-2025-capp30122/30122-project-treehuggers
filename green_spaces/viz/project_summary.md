# Chicago Parks and Demographics Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationships between park access, park quality, and socioeconomic factors across Chicago's neighborhoods. Using geospatial analysis and statistical methods, we examine how park distribution and quality correlate with demographic characteristics such as income levels, racial composition, and housing patterns.

Our analysis aims to identify potential inequities in park access and quality, providing data-driven insights that could inform urban planning and policy decisions to create more equitable green space distribution throughout the city.

## Key Questions

- **Access Disparities**: How does park access and proximity vary across different neighborhoods and demographic groups in Chicago?
- **Quality Correlation**: Is there a relationship between neighborhood income levels and the quality/amenities of nearby parks?
- **Demographic Patterns**: How do racial demographics correlate with park distribution, size, and quality?
- **Housing Connections**: What relationships exist between housing characteristics, property values, and proximity to high-quality parks?

## Methodology

Our approach combines several analytical techniques:

1. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping parks and demographic data by census tract to visualize distribution patterns
2. **Park Quality Index**: Creating a composite rating based on park amenities, size, review scores, and maintenance data
3. **Statistical Correlation**: Analyzing relationships between park metrics and demographic variables
4. **Interactive Visualization**: Building interactive dashboards to explore data patterns and relationships

## Data Sources

- **Chicago Park District Data**: Park locations, boundaries, facilities, and amenities
- **US Census Bureau**: Demographic data including income, race, population density by census tract
- **Housing Data**: Property values and housing characteristics from public records
- **Review Data**: Aggregated review scores from platforms like Google and Yelp

## Key Findings

Our analysis has revealed several significant patterns:

- Parks in higher-income areas tend to have higher quality ratings and more diverse amenities
- Significant disparities exist in park access across different racial and socioeconomic groups
- Neighborhoods with better park access show distinct housing and demographic patterns

## Explore the Data

This dashboard provides multiple ways to explore our findings:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: View correlations between demographics and park metrics
- **Detailed Kepler Map**: Explore detailed spatial relationships with advanced filtering
- **Statistical Visualizations**: Examine distribution patterns and relationships between variables
