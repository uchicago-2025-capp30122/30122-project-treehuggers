# Affordable Housing & Green Space Equity in Chicago

## Project Overview

Public parks and green spaces bring communities together, offering places for recreation, social interaction, and personal well-being. Policymakers and urban planners have a critical responsibility to ensure equitable access to high-quality green spaces for residents of affordable housing. This project evaluates the accessibility of high-quality public parks and green spaces near affordable housing units in Chicago, relative to other areas within the city.

By integrating housing data and census tract data with spatial and ratings data on Chicago green spaces, we develop an Accessibility Index that quantifies access to high-quality green spaces. This index considers key factors such as park ratings, size, and proximity to affordable housing developments and census tracts, highlighting disparities in green space accessibility across the city. To make these insights more accessible, we create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the index, allowing users to explore the data and identify areas with limited green space access.

This project offers policymakers and urban planners with a data-driven tool to identify areas where access to high-quality green spaces is limited, particularly for residents of affordable housing.

## Key Questions

- **Access Disparities**: How does park access and proximity vary across different neighborhoods and demographic groups in Chicago?
- **Quality Correlation**: Is there a relationship between neighborhood income levels and the quality/amenities of nearby parks?
- **Demographic Patterns**: How do racial demographics correlate with park distribution, size, and quality?
- **Housing Connections**: What relationships exist between housing characteristics, property values, and proximity to high-quality parks?

## Methodology

Our approach combines several analytical techniques:

1. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping parks and demographic data by census tract to visualize distribution patterns
2. **Park Quality Index**: Creating a composite rating based on park amenities, size, review scores, and maintenance data
3. **Statistical Correlation**: Analyzing relationships between park metrics and demographic variables
4. **Interactive Visualization**: Building interactive dashboards to explore data patterns and relationships

## Data Sources

- **Chicago Park District Data**: Park locations, boundaries, facilities, and amenities
- **US Census Bureau**: Demographic data including income, race, population density by census tract
- **Housing Data**: Property values and housing characteristics from public records
- **Review Data**: Aggregated review scores from platforms like Google and Yelp

## Key Findings

Our analysis has revealed several significant patterns:

- Parks in higher-income areas tend to have higher quality ratings and more diverse amenities
- Significant disparities exist in park access across different racial and socioeconomic groups
- Neighborhoods with better park access show distinct housing and demographic patterns

## Explore the Data

This dashboard provides multiple ways to explore our findings:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: View correlations between demographics and park metrics
- **Detailed Kepler Map**: Explore detailed spatial relationships with advanced filtering
- **Statistical Visualizations**: Examine distribution patterns and relationships between variables
