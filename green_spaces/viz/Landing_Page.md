## Abstract
Public parks and green spaces bring communities together, offering places for 
recreation, social interaction, and personal well-being. Policymakers and urban 
planners have a critical responsibility to ensure equitable access to 
high-quality green spaces for residents of affordable housing. This project 
evaluates the accessibility of high-quality public parks and green spaces near 
affordable housing units in Chicago.

By integrating housing data with spatial and user review data, we develop an 
Accessibility Index that quantifies access to high-quality green spaces. This 
index considers key factors such as park ratings, size, and proximity to 
affordable housing developments, highlighting disparities in green space 
accessibility across the city. To make these insights more accessible, we create
an interactive dashboard that visualizes the index, allowing users to explore 
the data and identify areas with limited park access.

This project offers policymakers and urban planners with a data-driven tool to 
identify areas where access to high-quality green spaces is limited, 
particularly for residents of affordable housing.
