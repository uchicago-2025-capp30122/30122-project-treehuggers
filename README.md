# Analyzing the Accessibility of Chicago Affordable Housing Units to High-Quality Green Spaces
Grace Kluender, Evan Fantozzi, Begum Akkas, Andrés Felipe Camacho

# Abstract
Our group is interested in investigating the accessibility of high-quality public
parks and other green public spaces near affordable housing units in in Chicago.
The city's Department of Housing maintains a list of affordable housing rental
units, available online and updated regularly. OpenStreetMap's API provides
coordinate locations of green spaces, and Yelp and Google’s APIs contain
data on the ratings of some of these green spaces.

In this project, we reconcile the city’s Department of Housing data with spatial
and user review data on green spaces. Then, we develop an index that quantifies
the accessibility to high-quality green spaces for the various affordable housing
developments. This index is based upon the ratings, area, and proximity of green
spaces to affordable housing developments.

# Data & Citations

1) OpenStreetMap Chicago Parks Data
The first set of data comes from OpenStreetMap, which is a free, open map
database (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap#:~:text=OpenStreetMap%20%28abbreviated%20OSM%29%20is%20a%20free%2C%20open%20map,and%20import%20from%20other%20freely%20licensed%20geodata%20sources). 

To extract coordinate data on Chicago green spaces and parks, we utilized the 
OSMnx tool in Python (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMnx). 

2) Affordable Rental Housing Developments Data

3) Yelp API Review Data

4) Google Places API Review Data
