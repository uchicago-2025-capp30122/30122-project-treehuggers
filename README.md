# Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago

## Abstract
Public parks and green spaces bring communities together, offering places for recreation, social interaction, and personal well-being. Policymakers and urban planners have a critical responsibility to ensure equitable access to high-quality green spaces for residents of affordable housing. This project evaluates the accessibility of high-quality public parks and green spaces near affordable housing units in Chicago, relative to other areas within the city.

By integrating housing data and census tract data with spatial and ratings data on Chicago green spaces, we develop an Accessibility Index that quantifies access to high-quality green spaces. This index considers key factors such as park ratings, size, and proximity to affordable housing developments and census tracts, highlighting disparities in green space accessibility across the city. To make these insights more accessible, we create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the index, allowing users to explore the data and identify areas with limited green space access.

This project offers policymakers and urban planners with a data-driven tool to identify areas where access to high-quality green spaces is limited, particularly for residents of affordable housing.

```

2) Syncoronize the libraries needed using ```uv```. This will install all the dependencies needed to run the code in the proyect

```
uv sync
```

3) (Optional) if there is a problem installing the dependency kepler, try this code that runs the project on a previuos version of python: 

```
deactivate #in case the virtual environment is active
rm -rf .venv
uv venv --python=python3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

5) After reviewing the data is complete, the project can be run as a module:
uv run python green_spaces 


# Data Source Citations

Below are the data sources used for the project. We focus heavily on spatial
data to achieve a visualization of the affordable housing index.

1) OpenStreetMap Chicago Parks Data: OpenStreetMap is a free database 
The first set of data comes from OpenStreetMap, which is a free, open map
database: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.01/-95.84
 
To extract coordinate data on Chicago green spaces and parks, we utilized the 
OSMnx API for Python (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMnx). 

2) Affordable Rental Housing Developments Data: downloaded CSV from city of Chicago's data portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Affordable-Rental-Housing-Developments-Map/k3g7-7kgc 

3) Yelp API Review Data: Used Yelps's Business Search API: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search 

4) Google Places API Review Data: Used Google's Nearby Search API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-nearby 

5) U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey Data: used ACS API to pull census tracts: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html
